# Specialised Cells ðŸ”¬
# - a GCSE Biology Matching Pairs Revision Game

------

This *GCSE Biology Revision Game* is a card-matching game that helps students to memorise **specialised cell types and their functions**. 

A specialised cell is any cell that has developed features to perform a specific job - e.g. a *red blood cell* has developed certain features to perform *its function of carrying oxygen around the body*. The specialised cell types chosen are from **the Biology curriculum at GCSE level**.

 The objective of the game is to **find the matching pairs of cards** - a labeled image of the cell type with a description of its function. 
 This game should hopefully be accessible enough and fun for anyone to play as a **quick-thinking memory style game**, but also can be used as a **revision tool** to help remember different cell types and their functions.

### Target Audience

The target audience of this game are students studying Biology at high school level (GCSE or equvivalent) and also those interested in learning some biological facts. The topic of Specialised Cells is included in the UK biology curriculum at KS3 and GCSE (including iGCSE) and this game can therefore be used as a fun revision / learning tool. It is also designed to be accessible without prior biology knowledge so hopefully will be enjoyed by any user of any age.

## Structure

### Existing Features

- **How To Play Button**

    - When clicked, this button opens a modal with instructions on how start and play the game. 

    ![screenshot](documentation/readme/feature-game-buttons.png)

- **Reset Button**

    - The mobile nav bar toggler, accessible on smaller mobile devices, collapses the navbar into a simple menu button that when clicked can open a list of the pages of the website. This allows for a cleaner UX design which takes up less space, but provides the user with the necessary navigation options. Clicking the icon opens the menu, and clicking again can close the menu.


- **Help Modal**

    - This feature contains images to visually and clearly explain the card match pairs (important, because the user has the option of clicking two of the same 'type' of card for efficiency, but they need to know this will not create a match). It also contains a table displaying the card images and their matching descriptions to provide learning support for the user. The user can understand how to start the game (if they are unsure) by reading "Click any card to start the game!". The help modal can be opened at any time during the game to remind users of how to play. The Boostrap modal contains a 'close' button to exit the modal (or the user can click the background screen to close).

    ![screenshot](documentation/readme/feature-help-modal.png)

- **Win Modal**

    - This feature pops open when a game has been completed (all 8 pairs of cards are matched). It shows a message congratulating the user on completing the game with an animated gif as a celebration. The user's final game time and move counter is included for reference. There are also links to downloadable content (x2 pdf files) which can supplement learning further. There is a 'Play Again!' button included at the bottom so users can restart the game / return to the main page after playing.
    
    ![screenshot](documentation/readme/feature-win-message.png)

- **Game Card Grid**

    - This feature contains all 16 game cards, separated into 2 well-defined grid containers which are easily distinguished by different card backface designs - cell type (images) and functions (written descriptions). There are 8 matching pairs and the cards flipto reveal their identity upon being clicked. When cards are matched, they remain open. If two cards are clicked that aren't a match, they flip back, allowing the user to try again until they match all pairs.

    ![screenshot](documentation/readme/feature-game-grid.png)

- **Timer**

    - This feature starts when the game begins (ie when a card is clicked). It starts from 00:00 and increments in seconds and minutes. The timer pauses when the help modal is open, so that users can stop to view the instructions without affecting their game time. When the modal closes, the timer resumes. The final time is logged in the win modal message so the user can aim to beat their score if they play again.

    ![screenshot](documentation/testing/user-story-game-feedback.png)

- **Move Counter**

    - The move counter starts whem the game begins and the first pair of cards have been clicked. It starts from zero and one move is added for each pair of cards that are attempted as a match. The final move count is logged in the win modal message so the user can aim to beat their score if they play again.

    ![screenshot](documentation/readme/feature-win-message.png)

- **Extra Revision Resources**

    - Links to free revision resources are included as a reward for completing the game and they are accessible from within the win modal message. Links open in a separate tab and offer a set of infocards / flashcards that the user can print and use at home.

    ![screenshot](documentation/testing/user-story-resources.png)


### Future Features

- **Option to increase difficulty level**
    - The infocards have already been designed with the potential to include 3 separate details to test learning of specialised cells knowledge (required for the GCSE Biology curriculum) - function / location / features. There could be increased difficulties levels where descriptions contain more complex information, or more cell types could be added as a bonus challenge.

- **Different related topic themes**
    - There could be an option to also add more revision topics to the game so the user can improve their knowledge in other areas of the curriculum.

- **Option of sounds effects**
    - Sound effects could be added for when cards are clicked, flipped, matched or not matched. This could be more fun and engaging for the user, and also gives them instant feedback of success or error which may improve learning. This feature could be made optional for when the user prefers a quiet game.

- **Improved responsiveness for smaller devices and for different screen orientations**
    - Details of some issues regarding responsiveness are detailed in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file and these would be worked on in future development. Adding more cell cards as options for the game, could allow the grid layout to be changed (e.g. maximum 3x6 instead of 4x4) to optimise card readability. In future, it may be preferable to also use a responsive grid framework (from Boostrap for example) to avoid some of the issues I faced during styling.

## Skeleton

Wireframes for the website were created using the UI wireframe tool, [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), to plan the layout across desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

The layout and design was kept consistent across the pages / devices as much as possible.

The main game page consists of:

- A title
- A subtitle description of the game
- A countdown timer is on the top left corner ofthe gamegrid - displays how many seconds are remaining during a game
- A moves counter that is on the top right corner of the gamegrid - displays the number of moves made during a game
- A gamegrid of separated into x2 8 divs displaying the rear side of the cards - two cards can be flipped over at a time to make a match
- A reset button is underneath the gamegrid - gives the user the option to reset the game to the beginning
- A howtoplay button is underneath the gamegrid - gives the user the option to view the game instructions and access the prelearning material
- A footer which contains a copyright statement

### Wireframes

These were the initial wireframes created for the project during the planning stage:

**1. Game Grid Wireframes**

- [Mobile and Table Devices](https://github.com/tarahwaters/milestone-project2/blob/main/documentation/readme/wireframe-mob-gamegrid.png "GameGrid Wireframe for Mobile and Tablet Devices")

- [Desktop Devices](https://github.com/tarahwaters/milestone-project2/blob/main/documentation/readme/wireframe-desktop-gamegrid.png "GameGrid Wireframe for Desktop Devices")

**2. HowToPlay Modal Wireframes**

- [Mobile and Table Devices](https://github.com/tarahwaters/milestone-project2/blob/main/documentation/readme/wireframe-mob-howtoplay.png "HowToPlay Modal Wireframe for Mobile and Tablet Devices")

- [Desktop Devices](https://github.com/tarahwaters/milestone-project2/blob/main/documentation/readme/wireframe-desktop-howtoplay.png "HowToPlay Modal Wireframe for Desktop Devices")

**3. WinMessage Modal Wireframes**

## Surface
### Color Scheme

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a color palette for the design.

![Biology Game Color Scheme](/documentation/readme/colorscheme.png "Biology Game Color Scheme")

### Typography

[fontjoy.com](https://fontjoy.com/) was used to create aesthetic font pairings for the project.

- **Kalam** - for the main title
- **Preahvihear** - for subtitles and headings
- **Sriracha** - for descriptive text (*in the end this font was not utilised)
- with a backup font of **"Sans serif"**

![Font pairings](/documentation/readme/typography.jpg "Font pairings")

### Card Design

Since the images of specialised cells available online were consistent or visually appealing enough in their design, I decided to draw my own using the Procreate app on my iPad. Here is the the full image containing all the cell drawings used in the game. These were then cropped to add to the individual cards.

![Specialised Cells Full Image](/documentation/readme/specialised-cells-full.png "Full image containing all Specialised Cells used on the game cards")

The images were resized to 500 x 500px to form the game cards, and a background and name label were added to each using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to edit.

The images were then converted to WEBP format to reduce their file size to improve website load times (using [RedKetchup](https://redketchup.io/)).

Example card design:

![Example Card Design](assets/images/cards/palisade-cell.webp "Example Card Design")

Card backfaces were designed differently to indicate which type of card they are - i.e. cell type (an image) or function (a description).
This was done to improve the user experience and became part of the game development to also separate the shuffling of the cards.

Example backface card designs:

![Example Backface Card Designs](documentation/readme/backface-designs.png "Example Backface Card Designs")



### Extra Learning Resource

As a prize for completing the game, users have access to a downloadable learning resource which summarises all the cell types used in the game.
Learners can print off the flashcards and use them for their biology revision.

Example images of a free learning resource available to download:
