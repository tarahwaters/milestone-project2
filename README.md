# Specialised Cells ðŸ”¬
# - a GCSE Biology Revision Game

------

This *GCSE Biology Revision Game* is a card-matching game that helps students to memorise **specialised cell types and their functions**. A specialised cell is any cell that has developed features to perform a specific job - e.g. a *red blood cell* has developed certain features to perform *its function of carrying oxygen around the body*. Once a cell has become specialised, its job is fixed. The specialised cell types chosen are from **the Biology curriculum at GCSE level**.

 The objective of the game is to **find the matching pairs of cards** - a labeled image of the cell type with a description of its function. There is the **added challenge of completing the game within a set timeframe**, and the user has the option of **increasing the level of difficulty** by adding more cell types to be tested on. This game should hopefully be accessible enough and fun for anyone to play as a **quick-thinking memory style game**, but also can be used as a **revision tool** to help remember different cell types and their functions.

### Target Audience

The target audience of this game are students studying Biology at high school level (GCSE or equvivalent) and also those interested in learning some biological facts. The topic of Specialised Cells is included in the UK biology curriculum at KS3 and GCSE (including iGCSE) and this game can therefore be used as a fun revision / learning tool. It is also designed to be accessible without prior biology knowledge so hopefully will be enjoyed by any user of any age.

### User Requirements and Expectations
### User Stories

#### User
As a user I would like:
- to play a card-matching memory game presented in a visually appealing format

### Color Scheme

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a color palette for the design.

### Typography

[fontjoy.com](https://fontjoy.com/) was used to create aesthetic font pairings for the project.

- **Kalam** - for the main title
- **Preahvihear** - for subtitles and headings
- **Sriracha** - for descriptive text
- with a backup font of **"Sans serif"**

### Card Design

Since the images of specialised cells available online were not to my liking and often weren't consistent in their design, I decided to draw my own using the Procreate app on my iPad. Here is the the full image containing all the cell drawings used in the game. These were then cropped to add to the individual cards.
