# Differentiated Cells and Functions ðŸ”¬
# - a GCSE Biology Revision Game

------

This *GCSE Biology Revision Game* is a card-matching game that helps students to memorise **differentiated cell types and their functions**. A differentiated cell is any cell that has become specialised to perform a specific job - e.g. a *red blood cell* has developed certain features to perform *its function of carrying oxygen around the body*. Once a cell has become specialised, its job is fixed. The differentiated cell types chosen are **required learning in the Biology curriculum at GCSE level**.

 The objective of the game is to **find the matching pairs of cards** - a labeled image of the cell type with a description of its function. There is the **added challenge of completing the game within a set timeframe**, and the user has the option of **increasing the level of difficulty** by adding more cell types to be tested on. This game should hopefully be accessible enough and fun for anyone to play as a **quick-thinking memory style game**, but also can be used as a **revision tool** to help remember different cell types and their functions.
